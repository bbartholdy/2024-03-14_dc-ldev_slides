# Quarto {.inverse}

## Why Quarto? {.smaller}

Quarto allows you to **seamlessly combine executable R code, its output, and text** in a single document. 

These documents **can be converted to multiple static and dynamic output formats**, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).

The benefit of a well-prepared Quarto document is **full reproducibility**.

On the witness stand is a smiling and confident R Markdown document pointing at some lines of code on itself. A fuzzy monster lawyer in a polka-dot tie stands proudly saying 'Nothing further!' The judge (also a cute fuzzy monster) is smiling with their hands raised in celebration of reproducible work."}


## Why Quarto?

Full reproducibility also means

- flexibility to add data and recompile
- no need to change all occurrences in a document
- easily fix mistakes made during analysis...

## Quarto Exercises {.center .inverse}


## Exercise 1 {.inverse}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Play around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the table,
and re-Render to see what each option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval: false` and `echo: false`? 

What is the difference between this and `include: false`?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

## Exercise 1: Solution {.inverse}

Create a chunk with `eval: false, echo: false`

then create another chunk with `include: false` to compare. 

`eval: false, echo: false` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the
code in the rendered document. The code chunk essentially doesn’t exist in the
rendered document...

...whereas `include: false` will run the code and store the output for later use.

See a comprehensive list of chunk options [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#execution)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/master/pkgdown/favicon/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png){.absolute height="120" right="0" top="-38"}

[**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a package (included in **tidyverse**) for creating highly customisable plots that are built
step-by-step by adding layers.

The separation of a plot into layers allows a high degree of flexibility with
minimal effort.

    ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
    <GEOM_FUNCTION>() +
    <CUSTOMISATION>

## Data Visualisation Exercises {.center .inverse}


## Exercise 2 {.inverse}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **6 mins**

Create a new code chunk with the label `fig-rooms-scatter`.

Create a scatter plot of `rooms` by `village` with the `respondant_wall_type`
showing in different colours. 

Does this seem like a good way to display the relationship between these variables?

What other kinds of plots might you use to show this type of data?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 6, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`


## Exercise 2: Solution {.inverse .smaller}

```{r exercise-2-setup, echo=FALSE}
#| label: setup-exercise2
#| include: false
percent_wall_type <- interviews_plotting %>%
    filter(respondent_wall_type != "cement") %>%
    count(village, respondent_wall_type) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
    ungroup()
```

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `geom_point`

```{r rooms-village-point}
#| out-width: "600"
#| fig-align: center
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, colour = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```

## `geom_jitter`

```{r rooms-village-jitter}
#| out-width: "600"
#| fig-align: center
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, colour = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2) +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```


:::

## Captioning {.smaller}

Now that we have created the plot, we can also create a caption using the `fig-cap` chunk option.

```{r}
#| label: fig-rooms-scatter
#| fig-cap: "This plot shows the relationship between the variables room and village, but doesn't do a very good job at it."
#| echo: fenced

interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, colour = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```


## Exercise 3 {.inverse}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example,
if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot.

Replace the box plot with a violin plot  
see `geom_violin()`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`


## Exercise 3: Solution {.inverse}

```{r exercise-3-sol, fig.width=9, fig.height=3.5, fig.retina=3}
interviews_plotting %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = "tomato")
```



## Exercise 4 {.inverse auto-animate="true"}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **8 mins**

Create a bar plot showing the proportion of respondents in each village who are 
or are not part of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`). 

Include only respondents who answered that question in the calculations and plot.

Which village had the lowest proportion of respondents in an irrigation association?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

## Exercise 4 {.inverse .smaller auto-animate="true"}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **8 mins**

Create a bar plot showing the proportion of respondents in each village who are 
or are not part of an irrigation association (`memb_assoc`). 

Include only respondents who answered that question in the calculations and plot.

Which village had the lowest proportion of respondents in an irrigation association?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

### Hint

```{r exercise-4-hint}
#| echo: true
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()
```


## Exercise 4: Solution {.inverse}

```{r exercise-4-sol, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.5, fig.retina=3}
#| echo: true
percent_memb_assoc <- interviews_plotting %>%
  filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
  count(village, memb_assoc) %>%
  group_by(village) %>%
  mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

percent_memb_assoc %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = memb_assoc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge")
```


## Exercise 5 {.inverse}

`r emo::ji("clock")` **4 mins**

Experiment with at least two different themes. Build the previous plot using each
of those themes. 

Which do you like best?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Hint

:::{.column}
`theme_minimal`  
`theme_void`  
`theme_classic`  
:::
:::{.column}
`theme_dark`  
`theme_grey`  
`theme_light`

## Exercise 5: Solution {.inverse}

::: {.r-stack}

```{r}
#| label: exercise-5-sol
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
percent_items %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    facet_wrap(~ items) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```
