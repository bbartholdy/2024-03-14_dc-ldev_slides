# Data Carpentry for Social Sciences & Humanities


Slides for day 2 of
[Data Carpentry for Social Sciences & Humanities](https://eur-nl.github.io/2024-03-14-ldev-rotterdam/).
Workshop held 14th and 15th October at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

Slides are based on previous slides by [Claudiu Forgaci](https://github.com/cforgaci)
and [Aleksandra Ewa Wilczynska](https://github.com/alwil), which were in turn
based on my other slides... At this point it is basically a group effort!
